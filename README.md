## WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies used:
Express: Express.js or simply Express is a back end web application framawork for building RESTful APIs with Node.js

NodeJs: Node. js is a single-threaded, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for building fast and scalable server-side and networking applications

Mongoose: Mongoose is a MongoDB ODM i.e (Object database Modelling) that used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node. js server

REST API: A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style.

Postman: Postman is an API Platform for developers to design, build, test and iterate their APIs. ESLint : ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code.

MongoDB Compass: MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI for querying, aggregating, and analyzing your MongoDB data in a visual environment.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

# Plans for Improvement

The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization. It's also be great to add additional clarity in server responses so the user is especially clear on what the probilem is and what their next steps are.
